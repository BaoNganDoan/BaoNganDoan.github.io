**Vietnam** is a Southeast Asian country known for its stunning landscapes, rich culture, and historical landmarks. It blends old traditions with modern life, making it a dream destination for travelers. The currency exchange rate is also very favorable for budget travelers, as the US dollar can go a long way, offering many experiences and purchases at a great value. It's not just because I was born there that I'm saying this, but having recently visited this past summer, I can say it offers the perfect blend of cultural experiences, from exploring ancient architecture to sharing street food with locals. Vietnam provides some of the most humbling, down-to-earth experiences, while also offering luxurious and modern options for those seeking a more upscale experience.
